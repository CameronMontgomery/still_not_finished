        <p>On valentine's day morning of 2018, I sat in the booking area of Douglas County Jail. Earlier that morning, I had been driving a stolen Jeep Grand Cherokee and, while stopped at a traffic signal, was lit up by the county sheriff. I punched the gas, and over the next 20 or so minutes, I led the police on a chase that involved multiple spike strips, going the wrong way on the highway, and a police dog that was very upset with me. I remember knowing I was about to get caught and wishing that I would get shot when I did, "suicide by cop" felt like it would be a blessing at the time.</p>
        <p>I don't bring this up to share a "war story" but highlight how morally bankrupt I had become. I didn't consider how much I would endanger the public driving on the wrong side of the highway or what shooting a suspect would do to the mental wellbeing of a police officer. I didn't care about anything that I was doing the lying, cheating, stealing, nothing. I hadn't always been this person.</p>
        <p>I graduated near the top of my class in high school. Joined the Marine Corps serving for five years with three deployments before being honorably discharged. After that, I worked offshore on an oil rig, making more money than I knew what to do with. But I wasn't okay. I suffered from PTSD, severe chronic depression, and anxiety. I would wake up covered in sweet screaming almost every night. I refused to get help because I viewed it as a weakness and a failing that I couldn't get through these things on my own. I started to self-medicate with Heroin, Meth, and anything else that caused me to be numb, and keeping numb was the only thing that mattered to me.</p>
        <p>Over the next two years, I caught felonies in two counties but was given probation and a deferred judgment because of my clean record before this. At no point did I get or seek any treatment, and after two months, I was getting high and dodging probation. This is what led up to me getting arrested that final time in Douglas County. I was facing 16 charges, 12 of which were felonies. On the first court date, I was offered a plea deal of 13 years D.O.C., but while walking back to our pod, the deputy with me, a Veteran named Frank Austin, told me about Veterans Treatment Court. V.T.C. is a prison deferment program for veterans with combat experience who have issues with substance abuse. I applied for the program and, a few months later, found out I was accepted.</p>
        <p>I wish that I could say that I wanted to join the program to get the help I needed, but it was to avoid going to prison. I was sent to a 30-day in-patient program at the V.A. and returned to about 10 hours a week in outpatient groups and therapy. I started to sleep through the night without the night terrors, and I stopped picking fights with others just so that I could get the anger out. I began to hate myself less. I connected with peers in the program and even involved myself with a veteran non-profit giving back to others still suffering from substance abuse.</p>
        <p>After 18 months in the program, I graduated and now have three years of sobriety. I would have never got the treatment that I needed if it hadn't been court-ordered. I probably still would be incarcerated, suffering from the same mental health problems that put me there, and when I got out, I think I would have recidivated. Veteran's Treatment Courts, Drug Courts, and Wellness Courts across the nation give what just putting people behind bars never will. It treats the problem and gives people like myself their lives back.</p>
