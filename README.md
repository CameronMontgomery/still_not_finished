## About

Still Not Finished is a lifestyle blog that is focused on giving a voice to survivors that against all odds were able to overcome trauma, mental health, addiction, or judicial involvement so that they can use that voice to inspire and help others. This was my first large project that I made and was created without frameworks using just HTML, CSS, and Vanilla JavaScript. It was a great learning experience and is a project that I wish to return to in the future as the cause is near to my heart.
